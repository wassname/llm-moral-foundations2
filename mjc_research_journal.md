It would be nice to extend this work https://github.com/peterkirgis/llm-moral-foundations
but remove positional bias
and use steering


ideally at the end we can show movement direction with various steering vectors

we can use
1. misalignment
2. compassjudger/qwen 14b/
3. extra
   1. nouse hermes llama 3b
   2. dolphin zephr allenai
   3. phi llama etc
- we can still permute choices, and good to cache
